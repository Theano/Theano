Some general Remarks
=====================

.. TODO: This discussion is awkward. Even with this beneficial reordering (28 July 2012) its purpose and message are unclear. 


Limitations
-----------

Theano offers a good amount of flexibility, but has some limitations too.
How then can you write your algorithm to make the most of what Theano can do?


- *While*- or *for*-Loops within an expression graph are supported, but only via
  the :func:`theano.scan` op (which puts restrictions on how the loop body can
  interact with the rest of the graph).

- Neither *goto* nor *recursion* is supported or planned within expression graphs.
