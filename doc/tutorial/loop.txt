Scan
====

- A general form of *recurrence*, which can be used for looping.
- *Reduction* and *map* (loop over the leading dimensions) are special cases of ``scan``.
- You ``scan`` a function along some input sequence, producing an output at each time-step.
- The function can see the *previous K time-steps* of your function.
- ``sum()`` could be computed by scanning the *z + x(i)* function over a list, given an initial state of *z=0*.
- Often a *for* loop can be expressed as a ``scan()`` operation, and ``scan`` is the closest that Theano comes to looping.
- Advantages of using ``scan`` over *for* loops:
  
  - Number of iterations to be part of the symbolic graph.
  - Minimizes GPU transfers (if GPU is involved).
  - Computes gradients through sequential steps.
  - Slightly faster than using a *for* loop in Python with a compiled Theano function.
  - Can lower the overall memory usage by detecting the actual amount of memory needed.

The full documentation can be found in the library: :ref:`Scan <lib_scan>`.

**Scan Example: Computing pow(A,k)**

.. code-block:: python

  import theano
  import theano.tensor as T
  theano.config.warn.subtensor_merge_bug = False

  k = T.iscalar("k")
  A = T.vector("A")

  def inner_fct(prior_result, B):
      return prior_result * B

  # Symbolic description of the result
  result, updates = theano.scan(fn=inner_fct,
                              outputs_info=T.ones_like(A),
                              non_sequences=A, n_steps=k)

  # Scan has provided us with A ** 1 through A ** k.  Keep only the last
  # value. Scan notices this and does not waste memory saving them.
  final_result = result[-1]
  
  power = theano.function(inputs=[A, k], outputs=final_result,
                        updates=updates)
  
  print power(range(10),2)
  #[  0.   1.   4.   9.  16.  25.  36.  49.  64.  81.]


**Scan Example: Calculating a Polynomial**

.. code-block:: python

  import numpy
  import theano
  import theano.tensor as T
  theano.config.warn.subtensor_merge_bug = False

  coefficients = theano.tensor.vector("coefficients")
  x = T.scalar("x")
  max_coefficients_supported = 10000

  # Generate the components of the polynomial
  full_range=theano.tensor.arange(max_coefficients_supported)
  components, updates = theano.scan(fn=lambda coeff, power, free_var:
                                     coeff * (free_var ** power),
                                  outputs_info=None,
                                  sequences=[coefficients, full_range],
                                  non_sequences=x)

  polynomial = components.sum()
  calculate_polynomial = theano.function(inputs=[coefficients, x],
                                       outputs=polynomial)

  test_coeff = numpy.asarray([1, 0, 2], dtype=numpy.float32)
  print calculate_polynomial(test_coeff, 3)
  # 19.0

**Exercise**

Run both examples.

Modify and execute the polynomial example to have the reduction done by ``scan``.
