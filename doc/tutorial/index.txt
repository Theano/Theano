Tutorial
========

Let us start an interactive session (e.g. ``python`` or ``ipython``) and import Theano.

>>> from theano import *

Many of symbols you will need to use are in the ``tensor`` subpackage
of Theano. Let's import that subpackage under a handy name like
``T`` (many tutorials use this convention).

>>> import theano.tensor as T

If that worked you are ready for the tutorial, otherwise check your
installation (see :ref:`install`).

Throughout the tutorial, bear in mind that there is a :ref:`glossary` to help
you out.
