Tutorial
========

Let us start an interactive session (e.g. with ``python`` or ``ipython``) and import Theano.

>>> from theano import *

Several of the symbols you will need to use are in the ``tensor`` subpackage
of Theano. Let us import that subpackage under a handy name like
``T`` (the tutorials will frequently use this convention).

>>> import theano.tensor as T

If that succeeded you are ready for the tutorial, otherwise check your
installation (see :ref:`install`).

Throughout the tutorial, bear in mind that there is a :ref:`glossary` as well
as *index* and *modules* links in the upper-right corner of each page to help
you out.
