TypeError: object of type 'TensorVariable' has no len()
-------------------------------------------------------

If you receive the following error, it is because the Python function *__len__* cannot 
be implemented on Theano variables:

.. code-block:: python

   TypeError: object of type 'TensorVariable' has no len()

Python requires that *__len__* returns an integer, yet it cannot be done as Theano's symbolic variables. However, `var.shape[0]` can be used as a workaround.

This error message cannot be made more explicit because the relevant aspects of Python's 
internals cannot be modified.


Faster gcc optimization
-----------------------

You can enable faster gcc optimization with the ``cxxflags``. This list of flags was suggested on the mailing list::

    cxxflags=-march=native -O3 -ffast-math -ftree-loop-distribution -funroll-loops -ftracer

Use it at your own risk. Some people warned that the ``-ftree-loop-distribution`` optimization resulted in wrong results in the past.
Also the ``-march=native`` flag must be used with care if you have NFS. In that case, you MUST set the compiledir to a local path of the computer.
