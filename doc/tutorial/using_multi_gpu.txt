Using multiple GPUs
===================

Theano has a feature to allow the use of multiple GPUs at the same
time in one function.  The multiple gpu feature requires the use of
the :ref:`gpuarray` backend, so make sure that works correctly.

In order to keep a reasonably high level of abstraction you do not
refer to device names directly for multiple-gpu use.  You instead
refer to what we call context names.  These are then mapped to a
device using the theano configuration.  This allows portability of
models between machines.

.. warning::

   The code is rather new and is still considered experimental at this
   point.  It has been tested and seems to perform correctly in all
   cases observed, but make sure to double-check your results before
   publishing a paper or anything of the sort.

.. note::

   For data-parallelism, you probably are better using `platoon
   <https://github.com/mila-udem/platoon>`_.

Defining the context map
------------------------

The mapping from context names to devices is done through the
:attr:`config.contexts` option.  The format looks like this::

    dev0->cuda0;dev1->cuda1

Let's break it down.  First there is a list of mappings.  Each of
these mappings is separeted by a semicolon ';'.  There can be any
number of such mappings, but in the example above we have two of them:
`dev0->cuda0` and `dev1->cuda1`.

The mappings themselves are composed of a context name followed by the
two characters '->' and the device name.  The context name is a simple
string which does not have any special meaning for Theano.  For
parsing reasons, the context name cannot contain the sequence '->' or
';'.  To avoid confusion context names that begin with 'cuda' or
'opencl' are disallowed.  The device name is a device in the form that
gpuarray expects like 'cuda0' or 'opencl0:0'.

.. note::

   Since there are a bunch of shell special characters in the syntax,
   defining this on the command-line will require proper quoting, like this:

   .. code-block:: shell

       $ THEANO_FLAGS="contexts=dev0->cuda0"

When you define a context map, if :attr:`config.print_active_device`
is `True` (the default), Theano will print the mappings as they are
defined.  This will look like this:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ THEANO_FLAGS="contexts=dev0->cuda0;dev1->cuda1" python -c 'import theano'
   Mapped name dev0 to device cuda0: GeForce GTX TITAN X
   Mapped name dev1 to device cuda1: GeForce GTX TITAN X


If you don't have enough GPUs for a certain model, you can assign the
same device to more than one name. You can also assign extra names
that a model doesn't need to some other devices.  However, a
proliferation of names is not always a good idea since theano often
assumes that different context names will be on different devices and
will optimize accordingly.  So you may get faster performance for a
single name and a single device.

.. note::

   It is often the case that multi-gpu operation requires or assumes
   that all the GPUs involved are equivalent.  This is not the case
   for this implementation.  Since the user has the task of
   distrubuting the jobs across the different device a model can be
   built on the assumption that one of the GPU is slower or has
   smaller memory.


A simple graph on two GPUs
--------------------------

The following simple program works on two GPUs.  It builds a function
which perform two dot products on two different GPUs.

.. code-block:: python

   import numpy
   import theano

   v01 = theano.shared(numpy.random.random((1024, 1024)).astype('float32'),
                       target='dev0')
   v02 = theano.shared(numpy.random.random((1024, 1024)).astype('float32'),
                       target='dev0')
   v11 = theano.shared(numpy.random.random((1024, 1024)).astype('float32'),
                       target='dev1')
   v12 = theano.shared(numpy.random.random((1024, 1024)).astype('float32'),
                       target='dev1')

   f = theano.function([], [theano.tensor.dot(v01, v02),
                            theano.tensor.dot(v11, v12)])

   f()

This model requires a context map with assignations for 'dev0' and
'dev1'.  It should run twice as fast when the devices are different.

Explicit transfers of data
--------------------------

Since operations themselves cannot work on more than one device, they
will pick a device to work on based on their inputs and automatically
insert transfers for any input which is not on the right device.

However you may want some explicit control over where and how these
transfers are done at some points.  This is done by using the new
:meth:`transfer` method that is present on variables.  It works for
moving data between GPUs and also between the host and the GPUs.  Here
is a example.

.. code-block:: python

   import theano

   v = theano.tensor.fmatrix()

   # Move to the device associated with 'gpudev'
   gv = v.transfer('gpudev')

   # Move back to the cpu
   cv = gv.transfer('cpu')

Of course you can mix transfers and operations in any order you
choose.  However you should try to minimize transfer operations
because they will introduce overhead any may reduce performance.
