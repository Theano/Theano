Testing your installation
--------------------------

Once you have installed Theano, you should run the test suite. 

.. code-block:: bash

    THEANO_FLAGS=''; python -c "import theano; theano.test()"

All tests should pass (skipped tests and known failures are normal). If
some test fails on your machine, you are encouraged to tell us what went
wrong on the ``theano-users@googlegroups.com`` mailing list.


Testing your installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once you have installed Theano, you should run the test suite. 

.. code-block:: bash

    theano-nose

If ``theano-nose`` is not found by your shell, you will need to add
``Theano/bin`` to your ``PATH`` environment variable.

.. note::

    In Theano versions <= 0.5, ``theano-nose`` was not included.  If you
    are working with such a version, you can call ``nosetests`` instead
    of ``theano-nose``. In that case, some tests will fail by raising
    the KnownFailureTest Exception, and will be considered as errors,
    but they are nothing to worry about.

.. note::

    The tests should be run with the configuration option :attr:`~config.device`
    set to ``cpu`` (default). If you need to change this value,
    you can do that by setting the :envvar:`THEANO_FLAGS` environment variable,
    by prefixing the ``theano-nose`` command with ``THEANO_FLAGS=device=cpu``.
    If you have a GPU, it will automatically be used to run GPU-related tests.

    If you want GPU-related tests to run on a specific GPU device, and not
    the default one, you should use :attr:`~config.init_gpu_device`.
    For instance: ``THEANO_FLAGS=device=cpu,init_gpu_device=gpu1``.

    See :ref:`libdoc_config` for more information on how to change these
    configuration options.

All tests should pass (skipped tests and known failures are normal). If
some test fails on your machine, you are encouraged to tell us what went
wrong on the ``theano-users@googlegroups.com`` mailing list.
