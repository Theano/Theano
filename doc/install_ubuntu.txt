Ubuntu Installation Instructions
################################

There are two ways of getting the dependencies for Theano. You can either grab them
as system packages or let pip do everything for you. In the end, Theano will be installed 
through pip.

Prerequisites through System Packages (optional)
================================================

If you want to acquire the requirements through your system packages and install
them system wide follow these instructions:

For Ubuntu 11.10 through 14.04:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt-get install python-numpy python-scipy python-dev python-pip python-nose g++ libopenblas-dev git

For Ubuntu 11.04:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt-get install python-numpy python-scipy python-dev python-pip python-nose g++ git libatlas3gf-base libatlas-dev

.. include:: install_generic.txt
    :start-line: 11


Manual Openblas instruction
---------------------------

The openblas included in some older Ubuntu version is limited to 2
threads. Ubuntu 14.04 do not have this limit. If you want to use more
cores at the same time, you will need to compile it yourself. Here is
some code that will help you.

.. code-block:: bash

    # remove openblas if you installed it
    sudo apt-get remove libopenblas-base
    # Download the development version of OpenBLAS
    git clone git://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS
    cd OpenBLAS
    make FC=gfortran
    sudo make PREFIX=/usr/local/ install
    # Tell Theano to use OpenBLAS.
    # This works only for the current user.
    # Each Theano user on that computer should run that line.
    echo -e "\n[blas]\nldflags = -lopenblas\n" >> ~/.theanorc
