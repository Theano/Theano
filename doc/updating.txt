Updating Theano
===============

Basic Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following command will update only Theano:

.. raw:: html

    <pre><span class="red">&#60;sudo&#62;</span> pip install <span class="blue">&#60;--user&#62;</span> --upgrade --no-deps theano</pre>

- Use :red:`sudo` for a root installation.

- Use :blue:`user` for a user installation without admin rights. It will install Theano in your local site-packages.

The following command will update Theano and Numpy/Scipy (warning bellow):

.. raw:: html

    <pre><span class="red">&#60;sudo&#62;</span> pip install <span class="blue">&#60;--user&#62;</span> --upgrade theano</pre>

- Use :red:`sudo` for a root installation.

- Use :blue:`user` for a user installation without admin rights. It will install Theano in your local site-packages.


If you installed NumPy/SciPy with yum/apt-get, updating NumPy/SciPy
with pip/easy_install is not always a good idea. This can make Theano
crash due to problems with BLAS (but see below). The versions of
NumPy/SciPy in the distribution are sometimes linked against faster
versions of BLAS. Installing NumPy/SciPy with
yum/apt-get/pip/easy_install won't install the development package
needed to recompile it with the fast version. This mean that if you
don't install the development packages manually, when you recompile
the updated NumPy/SciPy, it will compile with the slower version. This
results in a slower Theano as well. To fix the crash, you can clear
the Theano cache like this:

.. code-block:: bash

   theano-cache clear

Bleeding Edge Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To update your library to the latest revision, change directory (``cd``)
to your ``Theano`` folder and execute the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    git pull

You should update frequently, bugs are fixed on a very regular basis, and features are
added even more frequently!
