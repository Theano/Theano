CentOS 6 Installation Instructions
==================================

.. note::

    It is possible to have a faster installation of Theano than the one these
    instructions will provide, but this will make the installation more
    complicated and/or may require that you buy software. This is a simple set
    of installation instructions that will leave you with a relatively
    well-optimized version that uses only free software. With more work or by
    investing money (i.e. buying a license to a proprietary BLAS
    implementation), it is possible to gain further performance.


Installation steps
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 1) ``sudo yum install python-devel python-nose python-setuptools gcc
    gcc-gfortran gcc-c++ blas-devel lapack-devel atlas-devel``
 2) ``sudo easy_install pip``

Speed test Theano/BLAS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is recommended to test your Theano/BLAS integration. There are many versions
of BLAS that exist and there can be up to 10x speed difference between them.
Also, having Theano link directly against BLAS instead of using NumPy/SciPy as
an intermediate layer reduces the computational overhead. This is
important for BLAS calls to ``ger``, ``gemv`` and small ``gemm`` operations
(automatically called when needed when you use ``dot()``). To run the
Theano/BLAS speed test:

.. code-block:: bash

    python /usr/lib/python2.*/site-packages/theano/misc/check_blas.py

This will print a table with different versions of BLAS/numbers of
threads on multiple CPUs and GPUs. It will also print some Theano/NumPy
configuration information. Then, it will print the running time of the same
benchmarks for your installation. Try to find a CPU similar to yours in
the table, and check that the single-threaded timings are roughly the same.
