Installing Theano 
=================

.. note::

    Theano development version is very stable. DO NOT HESITATE TO USE
    IT. Also, most people use it.

    For our own research, we frequently can't wait for a release of
    Theano before using the updates of Theano. So we must keep it very
    stable. One mount after a release, we recommend people to use the
    development version. You can use the git hash version if you need
    to keep using a specific version.

    We keep Theano very stable by having our full tests suite run on
    each PR before merging. This include GPU tests. Also, all codes
    (without exception) get reviewed by someone else then the original
    author before merging.

Supported platforms:

.. toctree::
  :maxdepth: 1

  install_ubuntu
  install_macos
  install_windows
  install_centos6
  install_others

Once your setup is complete and if you installed the GPU libraries, head to :ref:`testing_the_gpu` to find how to verify
everything is working properly.

To update your current installation see :ref:`updating`.
