Installing Theano
=================

.. note::
    If you are a member of LISA Labo, have a look at :ref:`lisa_labo` for
    lab-specific installation instructions.


Requirements
------------

In order to use Theano, the following libraries and software will need
to be installed (MacOS and Windows users should refer to platform-specific
instructions below for detailed installation steps):

    Linux, Mac OS X or Windows operating system
        We develop mainly on 64-bit Linux machines. other architectures are
        not well-tested.

    Python_ >= 2.4
        The development package (``python-dev`` or ``python-devel``
        on most Linux distributions) is recommended (see just below).

    ``g++``, ``python-dev``
        Not technically required but *highly* recommended, in order to compile
        generated C code. Theano `can` fall back on a NumPy-based Python execution
        model, but a C compiler allows for vastly faster execution.
        g++ >= 4.2 (for openmp that is currently always used)
        more recent version recommended!

    `NumPy <http://numpy.scipy.org/>`_ >= 1.5.0
        Earlier versions could work, but we don't test it.

    `SciPy <http://scipy.org>`_
        Only currently required for sparse matrix and special functions
        support, but *highly* recommended. We recommend SciPy
        >=0.8 if you are using sparse matrices, because ``scipy.sparse``
        is buggy in 0.6 (the ``scipy.csc_matrix`` version of ``dot()`` has a
        bug with singleton dimensions, there may be more bugs) and we do not
        run tests with 0.7.

    A `BLAS`_ installation (with Level 3 functionality)
        Including the development headers (``-dev``, ``-devel``, depending on
        your Linux distribution). Mac OS X comes with the `Accelerate
        framework`_ built in, and various options exist for Windows (see
        below).

.. _Accelerate framework: http://developer.apple.com/performance/accelerateframework.html
.. _Python: http://www.python.org/

The following libraries and software are optional:

    `nose <http://somethingaboutorange.com/mrl/projects/nose/>`_
        Recommended, to run Theano's test-suite.

    `Sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/>`_ >= 0.5.1, `pygments <http://pygments.org/>`_
        For building the documentation. LaTeX_ and dvipng_ are also necessary
        for math to show up as images.

    `Git <http://git-scm.com>`_
        To download bleeding-edge versions of Theano.

    `pydot <https://code.google.com/p/pydot/>`_
        To be able to make picture of Theano computation graph.

    `NVIDIA CUDA drivers and SDK`_
        Required for GPU code generation/execution. Only NVIDIA GPUs using
        32-bit floating point numbers are currently supported.

Linux
-----

You can find the documentation :ref:`here <install_linux>`.


MacOS
-----

You can find the documentation :ref:`here <install_mac>`.

Windows
-------

You can find the documentation :ref:`here <install_windows>`.


Generating the documentation
----------------------------

You can read the latest HTML documentation `here
<http://deeplearning.net/software/theano>`__.
You can download the latest PDF documentation `here
<http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/theano.pdf>`__.

We recommend you look at the documentation on the website, since it
will be more current than the documentation included with the package.

If you really wish to build the documentation yourself, you will need
epydoc and sphinx, as described above. Issue the following command::

    python ./doc/scripts/docgen.py

Documentation is built into ``html/``.
The PDF of the documentation is ``html/theano.pdf``.
