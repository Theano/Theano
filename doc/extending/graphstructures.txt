Graph Structures
================

Theano represents symbolic mathematical computations as graphs. These
graphs are composed of interconnected :ref:`apply` and :ref:`variable`
nodes. They are associated to *function application* and *data*,
respectively. Operations are represented by :ref:`op` instances and data
types are represented by :ref:`type` instances. Here is a piece of code
and a diagram showing the structure built by that piece of code. This
should help you understand how these pieces fit together:


-----------------------

**Code**

.. code-block:: python

    x = dmatrix('x')
    y = dmatrix('y')
    z = x + y

**Diagram**

.. image:: apply.png

-----------------------

Arrows represent references to the Python objects pointed at. The blue
box is an :ref:`apply` node. Red boxes are :ref:`variable` nodes. Green
circles are :ref:`Ops <op>`. Purple boxes are :ref:`Types <type>`.

.. TODO
    Clarify the 'acyclic' graph and the 'back' pointers or references that
    'don't count'.

When we create :ref:`Variables <variable>` and then :ref:`apply`
:ref:`Ops <op>` to them to make more Variables, we build a
bi-partite, directed, acyclic graph. Variables point to the Apply nodes
representing the function application producing them via their
``owner`` field. These Apply nodes point in turn to their input and
output Variables via their ``inputs`` and ``outputs`` fields.
(Apply instances also contain a list of references to their ``outputs``, but
those pointers don't count in this graph.)

The ``owner`` field of both ``x`` and ``y`` point to ``None`` because
they are not the result of another computation. If one of them was the
result of another computation, it's ``owner`` field would point to another
blue box like ``z`` does, and so on.

Note that the ``Apply`` instance's outputs points to
``z``, and ``z.owner`` points back to the ``Apply`` instance.


An explicit example
===================

In this example we will compare two ways of defining the same graph.
First, a short bit of code will build an expression (graph) the *normal* way, with most of the
graph construction being done automatically.
Second, we will walk through a longer re-coding of the same thing
without any shortcuts, that will make the graph construction very explicit.

**Short example**

This is what you would normally type:

.. If you modify this code, also change :
.. theano/tests/test_tutorial.py:T_graphstructures.test_graphstructures_1

.. code-block:: python

    # create 3 Variables with owner = None
    x = T.matrix('x')
    y = T.matrix('y')
    z = T.matrix('z')

    # create 2 Variables (one for 'e', one intermediate for y*z)
    # create 2 Apply instances (one for '+', one for '*')
    e = x + y * z


**Long example**

This is what you would type to build the graph explicitly:

.. If you modify this code, also change :
.. theano/tests/test_tutorial.py:T_graphstructures.test_graphstructures_1

.. code-block:: python

    from theano.tensor import add, mul, Apply, Variable, TensorType

    # Instantiate a type that represents a matrix of doubles
    float64_matrix = TensorType(dtype = 'float64',              # double
                                broadcastable = (False, False)) # matrix

    # We make the Variable instances we need.
    x = Variable(type = float64_matrix, name = 'x')
    y = Variable(type = float64_matrix, name = 'y')
    z = Variable(type = float64_matrix, name = 'z')

    # This is the Variable that we want to symbolically represents y*z
    mul_variable = Variable(type = float64_matrix)
    assert mul_variable.owner is None

    # Instantiate a symbolic multiplication
    node_mul = Apply(op = mul,
                     inputs = [y, z],
                     outputs = [mul_variable])
    # Fields 'owner' and 'index' are set by Apply
    assert mul_variable.owner is node_mul
    # 'index' is the position of mul_variable in mode_mul's outputs
    assert mul_variable.index == 0

    # This is the Variable that we want to symbolically represents x+(y*z)
    add_variable = Variable(type = float64_matrix)
    assert add_variable.owner is None

    # Instantiate a symbolic addition
    node_add = Apply(op = add,
                     inputs = [x, mul_variable],
                     outputs = [add_variable])
    # Fields 'owner' and 'index' are set by Apply
    assert add_variable.owner is node_add
    assert add_variable.index == 0

    e = add_variable

    # We have access to x, y and z through pointers
    assert e.owner.inputs[0] is x
    assert e.owner.inputs[1] is mul_variable
    assert e.owner.inputs[1].owner.inputs[0] is y
    assert e.owner.inputs[1].owner.inputs[1] is z


Note how the call to ``Apply`` modifies the ``owner`` and ``index``
fields of the :ref:`Variables <variable>` passed as outputs to point to
itself and the rank they occupy in the output list. This whole
machinery builds a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) representing the
computation, a graph that Theano can compile and optimize.


Automatic wrapping
------------------

All nodes in the graph must be instances of ``Apply`` or ``Result``, but
``<Op subclass>.make_node()`` typically wraps constants to satisfy those
constraints. For example, the :func:`tensor.add`
Op instance is written so that:

.. code-block:: python

    e = dscalar('x') + 1

builds the following graph:

.. code-block:: python

    node = Apply(op = add,
                 inputs = [Variable(type = dscalar, name = 'x'),
                           Constant(type = lscalar, data = 1)],
                 outputs = [Variable(type = dscalar)])
    e = node.outputs[0]



Graph Structures
================

The following section outlines each type of structure that may be used
in a Theano-built computation graph. The following structures are
explained: :ref:`apply`, :ref:`constant`, :ref:`op`, :ref:`variable` and
:ref:`type`.


.. index::
   single: Apply
   single: graph construct; Apply

.. _apply:

Apply
-----

An *Apply node* is a type of internal node used to represent a
:term:`computation graph <graph>` in Theano. Unlike
:ref:`Variable nodes <variable>`, Apply nodes are usually not
manipulated directly by the end user. They may be accessed via
a Variable's ``owner`` field.

An Apply node is typically an instance of the :class:`Apply`
class. It represents the application
of an :ref:`op` on one or more inputs, where each input is a
:ref:`variable`. By convention, each Op is responsible for
knowing how to build an Apply node from a list of
inputs. Therefore, an Apply node may be obtained from an Op
and a list of inputs by calling ``Op.make_node(*inputs)``.

Comparing with the Python language, an :ref:`apply` node is
Theano's version of a function call whereas an :ref:`op` is
Theano's version of a function definition.

An Apply instance has three important fields:

**op**
  An :ref:`op` that determines the function/transformation being
  applied here.

**inputs**
  A list of :ref:`Variables <variable>` that represent the arguments of
  the function.

**outputs**
  A list of :ref:`Variables <variable>` that represent the return values
  of the function.

An Apply instance can be created by calling ``gof.Apply(op, inputs, outputs)``.



.. index::
   single: Op
   single: graph construct; Op

.. _op:

--
Op
--

An :ref:`op` in Theano defines a certain computation on some types of
inputs, producing some types of outputs. It is equivalent to a
function definition in most programming languages. From a list of
input :ref:`Variables <variable>` and an Op, you can build an :ref:`apply`
node representing the application of the Op to the inputs.

It is important to understand the distinction between an Op (the
definition of a function) and an Apply node (the application of a
function). If you were to interpret the Python language using Theano's
structures, code going like ``def f(x): ...`` would produce an Op for
``f`` whereas code like ``a = f(x)`` or ``g(f(4), 5)`` would produce an
Apply node involving the ``f`` Op.





.. index::
   single: Type
   single: graph construct; Type

.. _type:

----
Type
----

A :ref:`type` in Theano represents a set of constraints on potential
data objects. These constraints allow Theano to tailor C code to handle
them and to statically optimize the computation graph. For instance,
the :ref:`irow <libdoc_tensor_creation>` type in the ``theano.tensor`` package
gives the following constraints on the data the Variables of type ``irow``
may contain:

#. Must be an instance of ``numpy.ndarray``: ``isinstance(x, numpy.ndarray)``
#. Must be an array of 32-bit integers: ``str(x.dtype) == 'int32'``
#. Must have a shape of 1xN: ``len(x.shape) == 2 and x.shape[0] == 1``

Knowing these restrictions, Theano may generate C code for addition, etc.
that declares the right data types and that contains the right number
of loops over the dimensions.

Note that a Theano :ref:`type` is not equivalent to a Python type or
class. Indeed, in Theano, :ref:`irow <libdoc_tensor_creation>` and :ref:`dmatrix
<libdoc_tensor_creation>` both use ``numpy.ndarray`` as the underlying type
for doing computations and storing data, yet they are different Theano
Types. Indeed, the constraints set by ``dmatrix`` are:

#. Must be an instance of ``numpy.ndarray``: ``isinstance(x, numpy.ndarray)``
#. Must be an array of 64-bit floating point numbers: ``str(x.dtype) == 'float64'``
#. Must have a shape of MxN, no restriction on M or N: ``len(x.shape) == 2``

These restrictions are different from those of ``irow`` which are listed above.

There are cases in which a Type can fully correspond to a Python type,
such as the ``double`` Type we will define here, which corresponds to
Python's ``float``. But, it's good to know that this is not necessarily
the case. Unless specified otherwise, when we say "Type" we mean a
Theano Type.


.. index::
   single: Variable
   single: graph construct; Variable

.. _variable:



--------
Variable
--------

A :ref:`variable` is the main data structure you work with when using
Theano. The symbolic inputs that you operate on are Variables and what
you get from applying various Ops to these inputs are also
Variables. For example, when I type

>>> x = theano.tensor.ivector()
>>> y = -x

``x`` and ``y`` are both Variables, i.e. instances of the :class:`Variable` class. The :ref:`type` of both ``x`` and
``y`` is ``theano.tensor.ivector``.

Unlike ``x``, ``y`` is a Variable produced by a computation (in this
case, it is the negation of ``x``). ``y`` is the Variable corresponding to
the output of the computation, while ``x`` is the Variable
corresponding to its input. The computation itself is represented by
another type of node, an :ref:`apply` node, and may be accessed
through ``y.owner``.

More specifically, a Variable is a basic structure in Theano that
represents a datum at a certain point in computation. It is typically
an instance of the class :class:`Variable` or
one of its subclasses.

A Variable ``r`` contains four important fields:

**type**
  a :ref:`type` defining the kind of value this Variable can hold in
  computation.

**owner**
  this is either None or an :ref:`apply` node of which the Variable is
  an output.

**index**
  the integer such that ``owner.outputs[index] is r`` (ignored if
  ``owner`` is None)

**name**
  a string to use in pretty-printing and debugging.

Variable has one special subclass: :ref:`Constant <constant>`.

.. index::
   single: Constant
   single: graph construct; Constant

.. _constant:


Constant
^^^^^^^^

A Constant is a :ref:`Variable` with one extra field, *data* (only
settable once). When used in a computation graph as the input of an
:ref:`Op` :ref:`application <Apply>`, it is assumed that said input
will *always* take the value contained in the constant's data
field. Furthermore, it is assumed that the :ref:`Op` will not under
any circumstances modify the input. This means that a constant is
eligible to participate in numerous optimizations: constant inlining
in C code, constant folding, etc.

A constant does not need to be specified in a :func:`function
<function.function>`'s list
of inputs.  In fact, doing so will raise an exception.
