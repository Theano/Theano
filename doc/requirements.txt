Requirements
============

Theano is mainly develeopped on 64-bit Linux machines. 

These libraries are common to all Linux installations and should be installed
prior to using Theano.

    Python_ 2 >= 2.6 or Python_ 3 >= 3.3
        The development package (python-dev or python-devel on most Linux distributions) is recommended (see just below). Python 2.4 was supported up to and including the release 0.6. Python 3 is supported past the 3.3 release.

    ``g++``, ``python-dev``
        Not technically required but highly recommended, in order to compile generated C code. Theano can fall back on a NumPy-based Python execution model, but a C compiler allows for vastly faster execution. g++ >= 4.2 (for openmp that is currently always used) more recent version recommended!

    `NumPy <http://numpy.scipy.org/>`_ >= 1.7.1 < MAX_VERSION
        Earlier versions could work, but we donâ€™t test it.

    `SciPy <http://scipy.org>`_ >= 0.11 < MAX_VERSION
        Only currently required for sparse matrix and special functions support, but highly recommended. SciPy >=0.8 could work, but earlier versions have known bugs with sparse matrices.

     `BLAS`_ installation (with Level 3 functionality)
        Including the development headers (``-dev``, ``-devel``, depending on
        your Linux distribution).

The following libraries and software are optional:

    `nose <http://somethingaboutorange.com/mrl/projects/nose/>`_ >= 1.3.0
        Recommended, to run Theano's test-suite.

    `Sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/>`_ >= 0.5.1, `pygments <http://pygments.org/>`_
        For building the documentation. LaTeX_ and dvipng_ are also necessary
        for math to show up as images.

    `pydot-ng <https://github.com/pydot/pydot-ng>`_ or `pydot <https://code.google.com/p/pydot/>`_
        To handle large picture for gif/images.
	pydot-ng is a pydot compatible replacement that support newer Python.

    `NVIDIA CUDA drivers and SDK`_
        Required for GPU code generation/execution on NVIDIA gpus

    `libgpuarray`_
        Required for GPU/CPU code generation on CUDA and OpenCL devices (see: :ref:`gpuarray`.)

        .. note:: 

            OpenCL support is still minimal for now.

        .. note:: 
        
            libgpuarray is the new backend and is not required for the old version.
