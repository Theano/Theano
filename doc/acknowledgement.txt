* The developers of `NumPy <http://numpy.scipy.org/>`_. Theano is based on its ndarray object and uses much of its implementation.
* The developers of `SciPy <http://scipy.org/>`_. Our sparse matrix support uses their sparse matrix objects. We also reuse other parts.
* All Theano authors in the commit log.
* All Theano users that have given us feedback.
* The GPU implementation of tensordot is based on code from Tijmen
  Tieleman's `gnumpy <http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~tijmen/gnumpy.html>`_
* The original version of the function ``cpuCount()`` in the file
  `theano/misc/cpucount.py` come from the project `pyprocessing
  <http://pyprocessing.berlios.de/>`_. It is available under the same license
