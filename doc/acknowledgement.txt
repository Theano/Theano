* The developers of `NumPy <http://numpy.scipy.org/>`_. Theano is based on its ndarray object and uses much of its implementation.
* The developers of `SciPy <http://scipy.org/>`_. Our sparse matrix support uses their sparse matrix objects. We also reuse other parts.
* All Theano authors in the commit log.
* All Theano users that have given us feedback.
* The GPU implementation of tensordot is based on code from Tijmen
  Tieleman's `gnumpy <http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~tijmen/gnumpy.html>`_
* The original version of the function ``cpuCount()`` in the file
  `theano/misc/cpucount.py` come from the project `pyprocessing
  <http://pyprocessing.berlios.de/>`_. It is available under the same license
  as Theano.
* Our random number generator implementation on CPU and GPU uses the MRG31k3p algorithm that is described in:

    P. L'Ecuyer and R. Touzin, `Fast Combined Multiple Recursive Generators with Multipliers of the form a = +/- 2^d +/- 2^e <http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc00papers/090.PDF>`_, Proceedings of the 2000 Winter Simulation Conference, Dec. 2000, 683--689.

  We were authorized by Pierre L'Ecuyer to copy/modify his Java implementation in the `SSJ <http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~simardr/ssj/>`_ software and to relicense it under BSD 3-Clauses in Theano.
