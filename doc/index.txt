Welcome
=======

Theano is a Python library that allows you to define, optimize, and
evaluate mathematical expressions involving multi-dimensional
arrays efficiently. Theano features:

* **tight integration with NumPy** -- Use `numpy.ndarray` in Theano-compiled functions.
* **transparent use of a GPU** -- Perform data-intensive calculations up to 140x faster than with CPU.(float32 only)
* **efficient symbolic differentiation** -- Theano does your derivatives for function with one or many inputs.
* **speed and stability optimizations** -- Get the right answer for ``log(1+x)`` even when ``x`` is really tiny.
* **dynamic C code generation** -- Evaluate expressions faster.
* **extensive unit-testing and self-verification** -- Detect and diagnose many types of errors.

Theano has been powering large-scale computationally intensive
scientific investigations since 2007.  But it is also approachable
enough to be used in the classroom (University of Montreal's `deep
learning/machine learning <http://www.mila.umontreal.ca/Home/courses>`_ classes).

You can watch a quick (20 minute) introduction to Theano given as a talk at `SciPy 2010 <http://conference.scipy.org/scipy2010/>`_ via streaming (or downloaded) video:

  `Transparent GPU Computing With Theano`_.

Download
========

Theano is now `available on PyPI`_, and can be installed via ``easy_install
Theano``, ``pip install Theano`` or by downloading and unpacking the tarball
and typing ``python setup.py install``.

Those interested in bleeding-edge features should obtain the latest development
version, available via::

    git clone git://github.com/Theano/Theano.git

You can then place the checkout directory on your ``$PYTHONPATH`` or use
``python setup.py develop`` to install a ``.pth`` into your ``site-packages``
directory, so that when you pull updates via Git, they will be
automatically reflected the "installed" version. For more information about
installation and configuration, see :ref:`installing Theano <install>`.

Citing Theano
==============

If you use Theano for academic research, you are highly encouraged (though not
required) to cite the following two papers:

* F. Bastien, P. Lamblin, R. Pascanu, J. Bergstra, I. Goodfellow,
  A. Bergeron, N. Bouchard, D. Warde-Farley and Y. Bengio.
  `"Theano: new features and speed improvements"
  <http://arxiv.org/pdf/1211.5590.pdf>`_.
  NIPS 2012 deep learning workshop. (`BibTex
  <http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~lisa/publications2/index.php/export/publication/551/bibtex>`__)

* J. Bergstra, O. Breuleux, F. Bastien, P. Lamblin, R.
  Pascanu, G. Desjardins, J. Turian, D. Warde-Farley and Y.

  2010. June 30 - July 3, Austin, TX* (`BibTeX
  <http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~lisa/publications2/index.php/export/publication/461/bibtex>`__)

Theano is primarily developed by academics, and so citations matter a lot to
us. As an added benefit, you increase Theano's exposure and potential user
(and developer) base, which is to the benefit of all users of Theano. Thanks
in advance!

See our :ref:`citation` for details.

Help!
=====

How to Seek Help
----------------

The appropriate venue for seeking help depends on the kind of question you have.

* How do I? -- `theano-users`_ mailing list or `StackOverflow`_
* I got this error, why? -- `theano-users`_ mailing list or `StackOverflow`_ (please include the *full* error message, even if it's long)
* I got this error and I'm sure it's a bug -- `Github ticket <http://github.com/Theano/Theano/issues>`__
* I have an idea/request -- post the suggestion to `theano-dev`_ or, even better, implement the idea and submit a `GitHub <https://github.com/Theano/Theano/pulls>`__ pull request!
* Why do you? -- `theano-users`_ mailing list (not appropriate for StackOverflow)
* When will you? -- `theano-dev`_ mailing list (not appropriate for StackOverflow)

Please do take some time to search for similar questions that were asked and answered in the past. If you find something
similar that doesn't fully answer your question, it can be helpful to say something like "I found X but it doesn't
address facet Y" and link to the previous discussion.

When asking questions on StackOverflow, please use the *theano* tag, so your question can be found, and follow
StackOverflow's guidance on `asking questions <http://stackoverflow.com/help/asking>`__. Consider also using the
*python* and *numpy* tags, especially if you are unsure which library your problem relates to.

It's often helpful to include the following details with your question:

* If you have an error, the *full* error message, even if it's long
* Which versions of Python and Theano you're using
* Whether you're using a CPU or GPU device
* Details of your Theano configuration settings (you can print this in Python via `print theano.config <http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/library/config.html>`__)

Spending the time to create a minimal specific example of a problem is likely to get you to an answer quicker than
posting something quickly that has too much irrelevant detail or is too vague. A minimal example may take you a bit more
time to create but the first response is more likely to be the answer you need than, rather than a frustrated request
for clarification.


How to provide help
-------------------

If you see a question on the `theano-users`_ mailing list, or on `StackOverflow`_, that you
feel reasonably confident you know an answer to, please do support the community by helping others.

We were all newbies to Theano once and, as the community expands, there is a constant stream of new Theano users looking
for help. Perhaps you asked a question when you were first starting out? Now you can pay it forward by helping others.
It's also a good way to reinforce your own Theano knowledge.

Often it's easiest to answer a question directly but sometimes it may be better to refer people to a good answer that
was provided in the past. Pointing people to relevant sections in the documentation, or to a Theano tutorial, can also
be helpful.

When answering questions please `be nice <http://stackoverflow.com/help/be-nice>`__ (as always!) and, on
StackOverflow, follow their guidance for `answering questions <http://stackoverflow.com/help/answering>`__.
