Welcome
=======

Theano is a Python library that allows you to define, optimize, and
evaluate mathematical expressions involving multi-dimensional
arrays efficiently. Theano features:

* **tight integration with NumPy** -- Use `numpy.ndarray` in Theano-compiled functions.
* **transparent use of a GPU** -- Perform data-intensive calculations up to 140x faster than with CPU.(float32 only)
* **efficient symbolic differentiation** -- Theano does your derivatives for function with one or many inputs.
* **speed and stability optimizations** -- Get the right answer for ``log(1+x)`` even when ``x`` is really tiny.
* **dynamic C code generation** -- Evaluate expressions faster.
* **extensive unit-testing and self-verification** -- Detect and diagnose many types of mistake.

Theano has been powering large-scale computationally intensive scientific investigations
since 2007.  But it is also approachable enough to be used in the classroom
(IFT6266 at the University of Montreal).

News
====

* Theano 0.6rc3 was released. Everybody is encouraged to update.

* New technical report on Theano: `Theano: new features and speed improvements <http://arxiv.org/abs/1211.5590>`_.
  However, please keep citing the other paper below in scientific work involving Theano.

* `HPCS 2011 Tutorial <http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~lisa/pointeurs/tutorial_hpcs2011_fixed.pdf>`_.
  We included a few fixes discovered while doing the Tutorial.

You can watch a quick (20 minute) introduction to Theano given as a talk at `SciPy 2010 <http://conference.scipy.org/scipy2010/>`_ via streaming (or downloaded) video:

  `Transparent GPU Computing With Theano`_.

Download
========

Theano is now `available on PyPI`_, and can be installed via ``easy_install
Theano``, ``pip install Theano`` or by downloading and unpacking the tarball
and typing ``python setup.py install``.

Those interested in bleeding-edge features should obtain the latest development
version, available via::

    git clone git://github.com/Theano/Theano.git

You can then place the checkout directory on your ``$PYTHONPATH`` or use
``python setup.py develop`` to install a ``.pth`` into your ``site-packages``
directory, so that when you pull updates via Git, they will be
automatically reflected the "installed" version. For more information about
installation and configuration, see :ref:`installing Theano <install>`.

Citing Theano
==============

If you use Theano for academic research, you are highly encouraged (though not
required) to cite the following paper:

* J. Bergstra, O. Breuleux, F. Bastien, P. Lamblin, R.
  Pascanu, G. Desjardins, J. Turian, D. Warde-Farley and Y.
  Bengio. `"Theano: A CPU and GPU Math Expression Compiler"
  <http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~lisa/pointeurs/theano_scipy2010.pdf>`_.
  *Proceedings of the Python for Scientific Computing Conference (SciPy)
  2010. June 30 - July 3, Austin, TX* (`BibTeX
  <http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~lisa/publications2/index.php/export/publication/461/bibtex>`_)

Theano is primarily developed by academics, and so citations matter a lot to
us. As an added benefit, you increase Theano's exposure and potential user
(and developer) base, which is to the benefit of all users of Theano. Thanks
in advance!

* :ref:`install` -- How to install Theano.
* :ref:`introduction` -- What is Theano?
* :ref:`tutorial` -- Learn the basics.
* :ref:`libdoc` -- Theano's functionality, module by module.
* :ref:`optimizations` -- Guide to Theano's graph optimizations.

* :ref:`release` -- How our release should work.
* :ref:`acknowledgement` -- What we took from other projects.
* `Related Projects`_ -- link to other projects that implement new functionalities on top of Theano

You can download the latest `PDF documentation <http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/theano.pdf>`_, rather than reading it online.

Check out how Theano can be used for Machine Learning: `Deep Learning Tutorials <http://www.deeplearning.net/tutorial>`_.

Theano was featured at `SciPy 2010 <http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~lisa/publications2/index.php/publications/show/461>`__.

    "Thank YOU for correcting it so quickly. I wish all packages I worked
    with would have such an active maintenance - this is as good as it
    gets :-)"
