Generic user install instructions
=================================

Basic Installation
------------------

For a generic user installation on a Linux machine...

pip
~~~
    
The recommended way to obtain the latest stable version of Theano is from PyPI using
pip_. 

.. code-block:: bash

    [:rubric:`sudo`] pip install Theano [--:bluetext:`user`]

- Use :rubric:`sudo` for a root installation.
- Use :bluetext:`user` for a user installation without admin rights. It will install Theano in your local site-packages.


conda
~~~~~

say something about conda and miniconda


Bleeding-Edge Installation
--------------------------

If you are a developer of Theano, then check out the :ref:`dev_start_guide`.

The following are general instructions that will set you up with the
bleeding-edge version of Theano.

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone git://github.com/Theano/Theano.git
    pip install --user -e [cloned_folder]

The advantage of doing the -e switch is that it allows pip to keep track of Theano and
its dependancies. If you do not wish to use pip, you can simply run :

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone git://github.com/Theano/Theano.git
    cd Theano
    python setup.py develop

Using ``develop`` mode is
preferable to ``install`` as any modifications you make in the checkout
directory (or changes you pull with Git) will be automatically reflected
in the "installed" version without re-running ``python setup.py install``.

If you do not have permission to modify your ``site-packages`` directory you
can specify an alternative installation prefix using

.. code-block:: bash

    python setup.py develop --prefix=~/.local
