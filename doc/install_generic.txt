Generic Installation Instructions
#################################

If you want the latest on the edge installation of Theano, you want `bleeding_edge`_.
Otherwise go for the `stable`_.

.. _stable:

Stable Installation
-------------------

These are general instructions that will install the latest stable version of Theano.

pip
^^^

The recommended way to obtain the latest stable version of Theano is from PyPI using
pip_. 

.. raw:: html

    <pre><span class="red">&#60;sudo&#62;</span> pip install <span class="blue">&#60;--user&#62;</span> Theano[test]</pre>

- Use :red:`sudo` for a root installation.

- Use :blue:`user` for a user installation without admin rights. It will install Theano in your local site-packages.


Anaconda
^^^^^^^^

If you don't want to bother yourself with anything, you can install Theano under the Anaconda environment.

- Install Anaconda

- :code:`pip install Theano[test]`


.. _bleeding_edge:

Bleeding-Edge Installation
--------------------------

The following are general instructions that will set you up with the
bleeding-edge version of Theano.

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone git://github.com/Theano/Theano.git
    pip install [--user] -e git+git:github.com:Theano/Theano.git [--src cloned_folder]

The advantage of doing the -e switch is that it allows pip to keep track of Theano and
its dependancies. 

If you do not wish to use pip, you can simply run :

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone git://github.com/Theano/Theano.git
    cd Theano
    python setup.py develop

Using ``develop`` mode is
preferable to ``install`` as any modifications you make in the checkout
directory (or changes you pull with Git) will be automatically reflected
in the "installed" version without re-running ``python setup.py install``.

If you do not have permission to modify your ``site-packages`` directory you
can specify an alternative installation prefix using

.. code-block:: bash

    python setup.py develop --prefix=~/.local


Testing your installation
--------------------------

Once you have installed Theano, you should run the test suite. 

.. code-block:: bash

    THEANO_FLAGS=''; python -c "import theano; theano.test()"

All tests should pass (skipped tests and known failures are normal). If
some test fails on your machine, you are encouraged to tell us what went
wrong on the ``theano-users@googlegroups.com`` mailing list.
