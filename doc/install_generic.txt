Generic Installation Instructions
#################################

If you want the latest on the edge installation of Theano, you want `bleeding_edge`_.
Otherwise go for the `stable`_.

.. note::

   If you are behind a proxy, you must do some extra configuration steps
   before starting the installation. You must set the environment
   variable ``http_proxy`` to the proxy address. Using bash this is
   accomplished with the command
   ``export http_proxy="http://user:pass@my.site:port/"``
   You can also provide the ``--proxy=[user:pass@]url:port`` parameter
   to pip. The ``[user:pass@]`` portion is optional.


.. _stable:

Stable Installation
-------------------

These are general instructions that will install the latest stable version of Theano.

pip
^^^

The recommended way to obtain the latest stable version of Theano is from PyPI using
pip_. 

.. raw:: html

    <pre><span class="red">&#60;sudo&#62;</span> pip install <span class="blue">&#60;--user&#62;</span> Theano[test]</pre>

- Use :red:`sudo` for a root installation.

- Use :blue:`user` for a user installation without admin rights. It will install Theano in your local site-packages.


.. _bleeding_edge:

Bleeding-Edge Installation
--------------------------

The following are general instructions that will set you up with the
bleeding-edge version of Theano.

.. raw:: html

    <pre><span class="red">&#60;sudo&#62;</span> pip install <span class="blue">&#60;--user&#62;</span> <span class="green">&#60;-e&#62;</span> git+https://github.com/Theano/Theano.git#egg=Theano <span class="green">&#60;--src sourcefolder&#62;</span></pre>

- Use :red:`sudo` for a root installation.

- Use :blue:`user` for a user installation without admin rights. It will install Theano in your local site-packages.

- Use :green:`e` to make your installation file editable and :green:`src` to link it to your new :green:`sourcefolder`.

If you do not wish to use pip, you can simply run :

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone git://github.com/Theano/Theano.git
    cd Theano
    python setup.py develop


Testing your installation
--------------------------

Once you have installed Theano, you should run the test suite. 

.. code-block:: bash

    python -c "import numpy; numpy.test()"
    python -c "import scipy; scipy.test()"
    THEANO_FLAGS=''; python -c "import theano; theano.test()"

All Theano tests should pass (skipped tests and known failures are normal). If
some test fails on your machine, you are encouraged to tell us what went
wrong on the ``theano-users@googlegroups.com`` mailing list.
