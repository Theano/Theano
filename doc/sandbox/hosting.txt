Hosting Theano
==============

'''Historical Interest.  This has been addressed for now.  20080904'''

There are several [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_free_software_hosting_facilities project hosting services] online, but none is perfect for theano.

Wishlist:
 - version control (mercurial)
 - bugtracker (TRAC, ideally)
 - wiki
 - release file hosting
 - mailing list
 - reliability of hosting service

Should we get a domain name? To my dismay, theano.org, theano.com and theano.net are all taken. The first two seem legit, but theano.net doesn't look like it has anything on it and expires on May 29, so maybe there's a chance we can snag it? -ob

We could also get [http://www.theano.io]. -jpt

There are instructions for how to backup a Trac site, i just haven't gotten
around to it. Currently, the whole directory is rsynced to the lisa account,
which is close to ok, but not quite.

Writing scripts to update p-omega1/.ssh/authorized_keys2 automatically from
certain user accounts' authorized_keys2 file.  I've written this script, but not
really tested it.

Hooking up mercurial to trac would be nice, so we can associate commits and
tickets.

lgcm's uptime is usually about a week or two at max, so there's the pain in the
ass of having to re-log in, start up a screen session, find the directories,
restart trac, restart hg serve.  We should be restarting hg serve for tlearn too
soon.

Even if I do set up the authorized_keys2 script to do the right thing, the users
on TRAC and the users on the system are totally independent, so adding a new
user is non-standard and only I can do it right now.

My choices seem to be:
 - document all these hoops and good ideas
 - fix them so they are easier to use and document
 - replace them with hosting service

All of these options take time, mental effort, and the support of our
development group (look the large number of messages today on the topic)... so
i'm trying to find the least of all evils.  The Right Thing doesn't seem to have
appeared yet.
