Other software to look at and maybe recommend to users:

* [http://www.pytables.org/moin PyTables] - This is looking really
    promising for dataset storage and experiment logging... This might
    actually be useful for large data sets.
* [http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/ MatPlotLib] - visualization tools
    (plot curves interactively, like matlab's figure window)
* [http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/ PIL] - Python Image Library:
    write your matrices out in png! (Kinda a weird recommendation, I think)
* [http://www.logilab.org/857 pylint] - Syntax checker for python to
    help beautify your code. (We'd be hypocrites to recommend this :)
* [http://www.winpdb.org/ Winpdb] - A Platform Independent Python
    Debugger. (Except it doesn't really help you debug Theano graphs)
* [http://wiki.python.org/moin/IntegratedDevelopmentEnvironments Python
    Integrated Development Environments] - for all your coding needs
