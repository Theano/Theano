`cuDNN <https://developer.nvidia.com/cuDNN>`_ is an NVIDIA library with
functionality used by deep neural network. It provides optimized versions
of some operations like the convolution. cuDNN is not currently
installed with CUDA 6.5. You must download and install it
yourself.

To install it, decompress the downloaded file and make the ``*.h`` and
``*.so*`` files available to the compilation environment.
There are at least three possible ways of doing so:

- The easiest is to include them in your CUDA installation. Copy the
  ``*.h`` files to ``CUDA_ROOT/include`` and the ``*.so*`` files to
  ``CUDA_ROOT/lib64`` (by default, ``CUDA_ROOT`` is ``/usr/local/cuda``
  on Linux).
- Alternatively, on Linux, you can set the environment variables
  ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH``, ``LIBRARY_PATH`` and ``CPATH`` to the directory
  extracted from the download. If needed, separate multiple directories
  with ``:`` as in the ``PATH`` environment variable.
- And as a third way, also on Linux, you can copy the ``*.h`` files
  to ``/usr/include`` and the ``*.so*`` files to ``/lib64``.

By default, Theano will detect if it can use cuDNN. If so, it will use
it.  If not, Theano optimizations will not introduce cuDNN ops. So
Theano will still work if the user did not introduce them manually.

To get an error if Theano can not use cuDNN, use this Theano flag:
``optimizer_including=cudnn``.

.. note::

    Normally you should not call GPU Ops directly, but the CPU interface
    currently does not allow all options supported by cuDNN ops. So it is
    possible that you will need to call them manually.
