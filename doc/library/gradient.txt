:mod:`gradient` -- Symbolic Differentiation
===========================================

.. module:: gradient
   :platform: Unix, Windows
   :synopsis: low-level automatic differentiation
.. moduleauthor:: LISA

Symbolic gradient is usually computed from :func:`tensor.grad`, which offers a
more convenient syntax for the common case of wanting the gradient in some
expressions with respect to a scalar cost.  The :func:`grad_sources_inputs`
function does the underlying work, and is more flexible, but is also more
awkward to use when :func:`tensor.grad` can do the job.
