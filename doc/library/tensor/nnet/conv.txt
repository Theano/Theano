:mod:`conv` -- Ops for convolutional neural nets
==========================================================

.. note::

    Two similar implementation exists for conv2d:

        :func:`signal.conv2d <theano.tensor.signal.conv.conv2d>` and
        :func:`nnet.conv2d <theano.tensor.nnet.conv.conv2d>`.

    The former implements a traditional
    2D convolution, while the latter implements the convolutional layers
    present in convolutional neural networks (where filters are 3D and pool
    over several input channels).

TODO: Give examples for how to use these things! They are pretty complicated.

- Conv implemented
    - :func:`signal.conv2d <theano.tensor.signal.conv.conv2d>`.
    - :func:`nnet.conv2d <theano.tensor.nnet.conv.conv2d>`.
    - :func:`conv2d_fft <theano.sandbox.cuda.fftconv.conv2d_fft>`
      This is a GPU-only version of conv2d that uses an FFT transform
      to perform the work.  You can enable it by setting
      'THEANO_FLAGS=optimizer_including=conv_fft_valid:conv_fft_full'
      in your environement.  This is not enabled by default because it
      has some restrictions on input and uses more memory.
    - :func:`conv3D <theano.tensor.nnet.Conv3D.conv3D>`. Doesn't work on the GPU.
    - :func:`conv3d2d <theano.tensor.nnet.conv3d2d.conv3d>`
      Another conv3d implementation that uses the conv2d with data reshaping.
      It is faster in some cases than conv3d, specifically on the GPU.
    - `Faster conv2d <http://deeplearning.net/software/pylearn2/library/alex.html>`_

      This is in Pylearn2, not very documented and uses a different
      memory layout for the input. It is important to have the input
      in the native memory layout, and not use dimshuffle on the
      inputs, otherwise you lose most of the speed up. So this is not
      a drop in replacement of conv2d.

      Normally those are called from the `linear transform
      <http://deeplearning.net/software/pylearn2/library/linear.html>`_
      implementation.
