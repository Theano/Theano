Guide
=====

This module provides :func:`function`, commonly accessed as `theano.function`,
the interface for compiling graphs into callable objects.

You've already seen example usage in the basic tutorial... something like this:

>>> import theano
>>> x = theano.tensor.dscalar()
>>> f = theano.function([x], 2*x)
>>> f(4)
array(8.0)

The idea here is that we've compiled the symbolic graph (``2*x``) into a function that can be called on a number and will do some computations.

The behaviour of function can be controlled in several ways, such as
:class:`In`, :class:`Out`, ``mode``, ``updates``, and ``givens``.  These are covered
in the :ref:`tutorial examples <basictutexamples>` and :ref:`tutorial on modes <using_modes>`.

Reference
=========

.. class:: In

    A class for attaching information to function inputs.

    .. attribute:: variable

        A variable in an expression graph to use as a compiled-function parameter

    .. attribute:: name

        A string to identify an argument for this parameter in keyword arguments.

    .. attribute:: value

        The default value to use at call-time (can also be a Container where
        the function will find a value at call-time.)

    .. attribute:: update

        An expression which indicates updates to the Value after each function call.

    .. attribute:: mutable

        ``True`` means the compiled-function is allowed to modify this
        argument. ``False`` means it is not allowed.

    .. attribute:: borrow

        ``True`` indicates that a reference to internal storage may be returned, and that the caller is aware that subsequent function evaluations might overwrite this memory.

    .. attribute:: strict

      If ``False``, a function argument may be copied or cast to match the type
      required by the parameter `variable`.  If ``True``, a function argument
      must exactly match the type required by `variable`.

    .. attribute:: allow_downcast

        ``True`` indicates that the value you pass for this input can be silently downcasted to fit the right type, which may lose precision. (Only applies when `strict` is ``False``.)

    .. attribute:: autoname

        ``True`` means that the `name` is set to variable.name.

    .. attribute:: implicit

        ``True`` means that the input is implicit in the sense that the user is not allowed to provide a value for it. Requires 'value' to be set.
        ``False`` means that the user can provide a value for this input.

    .. method:: __init__(self, variable, name=None, value=None, update=None, mutable=None, strict=False, allow_downcast=None, autoname=True, implicit=None, borrow=None, shared=False)

        Initialize attributes from arguments.

.. class:: Out

    A class for attaching information to function outputs

    .. attribute:: variable

        A variable in an expression graph to use as a compiled-function
        output

    .. attribute:: borrow

        ``True`` indicates that a reference to internal storage may be returned, and that the caller is aware that subsequent function evaluations might overwrite this memory.

    .. method:: __init__(variable, borrow=False)

        Initialize attributes from arguments.


.. function:: function(inputs, outputs, mode=None, updates=None, givens=None, no_default_updates=False, accept_inplace=False, name=None, rebuild_strict=True, allow_input_downcast=None, profile=None, on_unused_input='raise')

    Return a :class:`callable object <theano.compile.function_module.Function>` that will calculate `outputs` from `inputs`.

    :type params: list of either Variable or In instances, but not shared
        variables.

    :param params: the returned :class:`Function` instance will have
      parameters for these variables.

    :type outputs: list of Variables or Out instances

    :param outputs: expressions to compute.

    :type mode: None, string or :class:`Mode` instance.

    :param mode: compilation mode

    :type updates: iterable over pairs (shared_variable, new_expression).
       List, tuple or dict.

    :param updates: expressions for new :class:`SharedVariable` values

    :type givens: iterable over pairs (Var1, Var2) of Variables.
       List, tuple or dict.  The Var1
       and Var2 in each pair must have the same Type.

    :param givens: specific substitutions to make in the
      computation graph (Var2 replaces Var1).

    :type no_default_updates: either bool or list of Variables
    :param no_default_updates:
        if True, do not perform any automatic update on Variables.
        If False (default), perform them all.
        Else, perform automatic updates on all Variables that are
        neither in ``updates`` nor in ``no_default_updates``.

    :param name: an optional name for this function.
      The profile mode will print the time spent in this function.

    :param rebuild_strict: True (Default) is the safer and better
        tested setting, in which case `givens` must substitute new
        variables with the same Type as the variables they replace.
        False is a you-better-know-what-you-are-doing setting, that
        permits `givens` to replace variables with new variables of
        any Type.  The consequence of changing a Type is that all
        results depending on that variable may have a different Type
        too (the graph is rebuilt from inputs to outputs).  If one of
        the new types does not make sense for one of the Ops in the
        graph, an Exception will be raised.

    :type allow_input_downcast: Boolean or None
    :param allow_input_downcast: True means that the values passed as
        inputs when calling the function can be silently downcasted to
        fit the dtype of the corresponding Variable, which may lose
        precision.  False means that it will only be cast to a more
        general, or precise, type. None (default) is almost like
        False, but allows downcasting of Python float scalars to
        floatX.

    :type profile: None, True, or ProfileStats instance
    :param profile: accumulate profiling information into a given
        ProfileStats instance. If argument is `True` then a new
        ProfileStats instance will be used.  This profiling object
        will be available via self.profile.

    :param on_unused_input: What to do if a variable in the 'inputs'
        list is not used in the graph. Possible values are 'raise',
        'warn', and 'ignore'.

    :rtype: :class:`Function <theano.compile.function_module.Function>`
            instance

    :returns: a callable object that will compute the outputs (given the inputs)
      and update the implicit function arguments according to the `updates`.


    Inputs can be given as variables or In instances.
    :class:`In` instances also have a variable, but they attach some extra
    information about how call-time arguments corresponding to that variable
    should be used.  Similarly, :class:`Out` instances can attach information
    about how output variables should be returned.

    The default is typically 'FAST_RUN' but this can be changed in
    :doc:`theano.config <../config>`.  The mode
    argument controls the sort of optimizations that will be applied to the
    graph, and the way the optimized graph will be evaluated.

    After each function evaluation, the `updates` mechanism can replace the
    value of any SharedVariable [implicit] inputs with new values computed
    from the expressions in the `updates` list.  An exception will be raised
    if you give two update expressions for the same SharedVariable input (that
    doesn't make sense).

    If a SharedVariable is not given an update expression, but has a
    ``default_update`` member containing an expression, this expression
    will be used as the update expression for this variable.  Passing
    ``no_default_updates=True`` to ``function`` disables this behavior
    entirely, passing ``no_default_updates=[sharedvar1, sharedvar2]``
    disables it for the mentioned variables.

    Regarding givens: Be careful to make sure that these substitutions are
    independent, because behaviour when Var1 of one pair appears in the graph leading
    to Var2 in another expression is undefined (e.g. with ``{a: x, b: a + 1}``).
    Replacements specified with
    givens are different from optimizations in that Var2 is not expected to be
    equivalent to Var1.
