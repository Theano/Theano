TODO: better Theano conv doc

# NB: Following notes contains infos since 0.9.0.

Highlights:
 - Support NumPy ``1.13``
 - Support pygpu ``0.7``
 - Added conda recipe
 - Moved Python 3.* minimum supported version from 3.3 to 3.4
 - Replaced deprecated package ``nose-parameterized`` with up-to-date package ``parameterized`` for Theano requirements
 - Theano now internally uses ``sha256`` instead of ``md5`` to work on systems that forbide ``md5`` for security reason
 - Removed old GPU backend ``theano.sandbox.cuda``. New backend ``theano.gpuarray`` is now the official GPU backend
 - Support more debuggers for ``PdbBreakpoint``

 - Scan improvements

   - Speed up Theano scan compilation and gradient computation
   - Added meaningful message when missing inputs to scan

 - Speed up graph toposort algorithm
 - Faster C compilation by massively using a new interface for op params
 - Faster optimization step, with new optional destroy handler
 - Documentation updated and more complete

   - Added documentation for RNNBlock

 - Many bug fixes, crash fixes and warning improvements

Interface changes:
 - Added new parameter ``target`` for MRG functions
 - Merged duplicated diagonal functions into two ops: ``ExtractDiag`` (extract a diagonal to a vector),
   and ``AllocDiag`` (set a vector as a diagonal of an empty array)
 - Renamed ``MultinomialWOReplacementFromUniform`` to ``ChoiceFromUniform``

 - Removed or deprecated Theano flags:

   - ``cublas.lib``
   - ``cuda.enabled``
   - ``enable_initial_driver_test``
   - ``gpuarray.sync``
   - ``home``
   - ``lib.cnmem``
   - ``nvcc.*`` flags
   - ``pycuda.init``

 - Changed ``grad()`` method to ``L_op()`` in ops that need the outputs to compute gradient

Convolution updates:
 - Removed old ``conv3d`` interface
 - Deprecated old ``conv2d`` interface
 - Updated ``conv`` documentation
 - Extended Theano flag ``dnn.enabled`` with new option ``no_check`` to help speed up cuDNN importation
 - Added unshared convolutions
 - Implemented separable convolutions for 2D and 3D
 - Implemented grouped convolutions for 2D and 3D
 - Automatic addition of cuDNN DLL path to ``PATH`` environment variable on Windows

GPU:

 - Prevent GPU initialization when not required
 - Added disk caching option for kernels
 - Added method ``my_theano_function.sync_shared()`` to help synchronize GPU Theano functions
 - Added useful stats for GPU in profile mode
 - Added Cholesky op based on ``cusolver`` backend

     to help configure Theano when CUDA and cuDNN can not be found automatically.

 - Updated ``float16`` support

   - Added documentation for GPU float16 ops
   - Support ``float16`` for ``GpuGemmBatch``
   - Started to use ``float32`` precision for computations that don't support ``float16`` on GPU

   Currently used for subtensor Ops only.
 - Added new Theano flag ``cycle_detection`` to speed-up optimization step by reducing time spending in inplace optimizations
 - Added new Theano flag ``check_stack_trace`` to help check the stack trace during optimization process
 - Added new Theano flag ``cmodule.debug`` to allow a debug mode for Theano C code. Currently used for cuDNN convolutions only.
