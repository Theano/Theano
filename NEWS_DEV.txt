TODO: better Theano conv doc

# NB: Following notes contains infos since 0.9.0.

Highlights:
 - Moved Python 3.* minimum supported version from 3.3 to 3.4
 - Replaced deprecated package ``nose-parameterized`` with up-to-date package ``parameterized`` for Theano requirements
 - Theano now internally uses ``sha256`` instead of ``md5`` to work on systems that forbide ``md5`` for security reason
 - Removed old GPU backend ``theano.sandbox.cuda``. New backend ``theano.gpuarray`` is now the official GPU backend
 - Support more debuggers for ``PdbBreakpoint``

 - Scan improvements

   - Speed up Theano scan compilation and gradient computation
   - Added meaningful message when missing inputs to scan

 - Speed up graph toposort algorithm
 - Faster C compilation by massively using a new interface for op params
 - Faster optimization step
 - Documentation updated and more complete
 - Many bug fixes, crash fixes and warning improvements

Interface changes:
 - Merged duplicated diagonal functions into two ops: ``ExtractDiag`` (extract a diagonal to a vector),
   and ``AllocDiag`` (set a vector as a diagonal of an empty array)
 - Renamed ``MultinomialWOReplacementFromUniform`` to ``ChoiceFromUniform``

 - Removed or deprecated Theano flags:

   - ``cublas.lib``
   - ``cuda.enabled``
   - ``enable_initial_driver_test``
   - ``gpuarray.sync``
   - ``home``
   - ``lib.cnmem``
   - ``nvcc.*`` flags
   - ``pycuda.init``

 - Changed ``grad()`` method to ``L_op()`` in ops that need the outputs to compute gradient

Convolution updates:
 - Extended Theano flag ``dnn.enabled`` with new option ``no_check`` to help speed up cuDNN importation
 - Implemented separable convolutions
 - Implemented grouped convolutions

GPU:
 - Prevent GPU initialization when not required
 - Added disk caching option for kernels
 - Added method ``my_theano_function.sync_shared()`` to help synchronize GPU Theano functions
 - Added useful stats for GPU in profile mode
 - Added Cholesky op based on ``cusolver`` backend
 - Added GPU ops based on `magma library <http://icl.cs.utk.edu/magma/software/>`_:
   SVD, matrix inverse, QR, cholesky and eigh
 - Added ``GpuCublasTriangularSolve``
 - Added atomic addition and exchange for ``long long`` values in ``GpuAdvancedIncSubtensor1_dev20``
 - Support log gamma function for all non-complex types
 - Support GPU SoftMax in both OpenCL and CUDA
 - Support offset parameter ``k`` for ``GpuEye``
 - ``CrossentropyCategorical1Hot`` and its gradient are now lifted to GPU

 - Better cuDNN support

   - Official support for ``v5.*`` and ``v6.*``
   - Better support and loading on Windows and Mac
   - Support cuDNN v6 dilated convolutions
   - Support cuDNN v6 reductions
   - Added new Theano flags ``cuda.include_path``, ``dnn.base_path`` and ``dnn.bin_path``
     to help configure Theano when CUDA and cuDNN can not be found automatically.

 - Updated ``float16`` support

   - Added documentation for GPU float16 ops
   - Support ``float16`` for ``GpuGemmBatch``
   - Started to use ``float32`` precision for computations that don't support ``float16`` on GPU

New features:
 - Added a wrapper for `Baidu's CTC <https://github.com/baidu-research/warp-ctc>`_ cost and gradient functions
 - Added scalar and elemwise CPU ops for modified Bessel function of order 0 and 1 from ``scipy.special``.
 - Added Scaled Exponential Linear Unit (SELU) activation
 - Added sigmoid_binary_crossentropy function
 - Added tri-gamma function
 - Added modes ``half`` and ``full`` for ``Images2Neibs`` ops
 - Implemented gradient for ``AbstractBatchNormTrainGrad``
 - Implemented gradient for matrix pseudoinverse op
 - Added new prop `replace` for ``ChoiceFromUniform`` op
 - Added new prop ``on_error`` for CPU ``Cholesky`` op
 - Added new Theano flag ``deterministic`` to help control how Theano optimize certain ops that have deterministic versions.
   Currently used for subtensor Ops only.
 - Added new Theano flag ``cycle_detection`` to speed-up optimization step by reducing time spending in inplace optimizations
 - Added new Theano flag ``check_stack_trace`` to help check the stack trace during optimization process
 - Added new Theano flag ``cmodule.debug`` to allow a debug mode for Theano C code. Currently used for cuDNN convolutions only.

Others:
 - Added deprecation warning for the softmax and logsoftmax vector case
 - Added a warning to announce that C++ compiler will become mandatory in next Theano release ``0.11``

Other more detailed changes:
 - Removed useless warning when profile is manually disabled
 - Added tests for abstract conv
 - Added options for `disconnected_outputs` to Rop
 - Removed ``theano/compat/six.py``
 - Removed ``COp.get_op_params()``
 - Support of list of strings for ``Op.c_support_code()``, to help not duplicate support codes
 - Macro names provided for array properties are now standardized in both CPU and GPU C codes
 - Started to move C code files into separate folder ``c_code`` in every Theano module
 - Many improvements for Travis CI tests (with better splitting for faster testing)
 - Many improvements for Jenkins CI tests: daily testings on Mac and Windows in addition to Linux
