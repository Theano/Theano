Modifications in the trunk since the last release

Partial of what is in trunk since the last release
--------------------------------------------------
Deprecation:
 * tag.shape attribute deprecated (#633)
 * FAST_RUN_NOGC mode deprecated
 * CudaNdarray_new_null is deprecated in favour of CudaNdarray_New
 * Dividing integers with / is deprecated: use // for integer division, or
   cast one of the integers to a float type if you want a float result (you may
   also change this behavior with config.int_division).

Bugs fixed:
 * Bugfix in CudaNdarray.__iadd__. When it is not implemented, return the error.
 * Typo fixed in tensor/opt.py
 * THEANO_FLAGS='optimizer=None' now works as expected
 * Fixed memory leak in error handling on GPU-to-host copy
 * Fix relating specifically to Python 2.7 on Mac OS X
 * infer_shape can now handle Python longs
 * Fixed behaviour of pydotprint's max_label_size option
 * Trying to compute x % y with one or more arguments being complex now
   raises an error.
 * The output of random samples computed with uniform(..., dtype=...) is
   guaranteed to be of the specified dtype instead of potentially being of a
   higher-precision dtype.
 * Python 2.4 syntax fixes.

Crash fixed:
 * Work around a bug in gcc 4.3.0 that make the compilation of 2d convolution
   crash.

Optimization:
 * Optimize 4 pattern of subtensor followed by subtensor.
 * Gemm inplace optimization on the GPU re-enabled

GPU:
 * Move to the gpu fused elemwise that have other dtype then float32 in them
   (except float64) if the input and output are float32.
   * This allow to move elemwise comparisons to the GPU if we cast it to
     float32 after that.
 * Implemented CudaNdarray.ndim to have the same interface in ndarray.
 * Fixed slowdown caused by multiple chained views on CudaNdarray objects
 * CudaNdarray_alloc_contiguous changed so as to never try to free
   memory on a view: new "base" property
 * Safer decref behaviour in CudaNdarray in case of failed allocations
 * New GPU implementation of tensor.basic.outer
 * Multinomial random variates now available on GPU

New features:
 * ProfileMode
    * profile the scan overhead
    * simple hook system to add profiler
    * reordered the output to be in the order of more general to more specific
 * var[vector of index] now work, (grad work recursively, the direct grad
   work inplace, gpu work)
    * limitation: work only of the outer most dimensions.
 * test_value implementation to allow quick debugging at graph creation time
 * cuda.root inferred if nvcc is on the path, otherwise defaults to
   /usr/local/cuda
 * Better graph printing for graphs involving a scan subgraph
 * Casting behavior is closer to numpy by default, and can be controlled
   through config.cast_policy.
 * Smarter C module cache, avoiding erroneous usage of the wrong C
   implementation when some options change, and avoiding recompiling the
   same module multiple times in some situations.
 * The "theano-cache clear" command now clears the cache more thoroughly.
 * More extensive linear algebra ops (CPU only) that wrap scipy.linalg
   now available in the sandbox.
 * CUDA devices 4 - 16 should now be available if present.
 * infer_shape support for the View op, better infer_shape support in Scan

Documentation:
 * Better commenting of cuda_ndarray.cu
 * Fixes in the scan documentation: add missing declarations/print statements
 * Better error message on failed __getitem__
 * Updated documentation on profile mode
 * Better documentation of testing on Windows
 * Better documentation of the 'run_individual_tests' script

Unit tests:
 * More strict float comparaison by default
 * Reuse test for subtensor of tensor for gpu tensor(more gpu test)
 * Tests that check for aliased function inputs and assure appropriate copying
   (#374)
 * Better test of copies in CudaNdarray
 * New tests relating to the new base pointer requirements
 * Better scripts to run tests individually or in batches
 * Some tests are now run whenever cuda is available and not just when it has
   been enabled before
 * Tests display less pointless warnings.

Other:
 * ?? a bug?? Correctly put the broadcast flag to True in the output var of
   a Rehapse op when we receive an int 1 in the new shape.
 * pydotprint: high contrast mode is now the default
 * More compact printing (ignore leading "Composite" in op names)

(To be continued...)
