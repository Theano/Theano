"""
This script should behave the same as the `nosetests` command.

The reason for its existence is that on some systems, it may not be obvious to
find where nosetests is installed in order to run it in a different process.

It is also used to load the KnownFailure plugin, in order to hide
KnownFailureTests error messages. Use --without-knownfailure to
disable that plugin.

If the --batch option is used, it will call `run_tests_in_batch.py`,
in order to run the tests by batches, not all at the same time.
`run_tests_in_batch.py` will in turn call back this script in another
process.

        This script behaves mostly the same as the `nosetests` command.

        The main difference is that it loads automatically the
        KnownFailure plugin, in order to hide KnownFailureTests error
        messages. It also supports executing tests by batches.

        Options:

            --batch[=n]: Do not run all the tests in one run, but split
                         the execution in batches of `n` tests each.
                         Default n is 100.

            --without-knownfailure: Do not load the KnownFailure plugin.
