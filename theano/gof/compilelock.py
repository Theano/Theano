    Obtain lock access by creating a given temporary directory (whose base will

    If access is refused by the same lock owner during more than 'timeout'
    seconds, then the current lock is overridden. If timeout is None, then no
    timeout is performed.

    The lock is performed by creating a 'lock' file in 'tmp_dir' that contains
    a unique id identifying the owner of the lock (the process id, followed by
    a random string).

    When there is already a lock, the process sleeps for a random amount of
    time between min_wait and max_wait seconds before trying again.

    wait for the lock. If it is set to a value >1, then this message will be
