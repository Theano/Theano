class Type(object2, PureType, CLinkerType):
    """Convenience wrapper combining `PureType` and `CLinkerType`.

    Theano comes with several subclasses of such as:

    - `Generic`: for any python type

    - `TensorType`: for numpy.ndarray

    - `SparseType`: for scipy.sparse

    But you are encouraged to write your own, as described in WRITEME.

    The following following code illustrates the use of a Type instance, here tensor.fvector:

    .. code-block:: python

        # Declare a symbolic floating-point vector using __call__
        b = tensor.fvector()

        # Create a second Variable with the same Type instance
        c = tensor.fvector()

    Whenever you create a symbolic variable in theano (technically, `Variable`) it will contain a
    reference to a Type instance.  That reference is typically constant during the lifetime of
    the Variable.  Many variables can refer to a single Type instance, as do b and c above.  The
    Type instance defines the kind of value which might end up in that variable when executing
    a `Function`.  In this sense, theano is like a strongly-typed language because the types
    are included in the graph before the values.  In our example above, b is a Variable which is
    guaranteed to correspond to a numpy.ndarray of rank 1 when we try to do some computations
    with it.

    Many `Op` instances will raise an exception if they are applied to inputs with incorrect
    types.  Type references are also useful to do type-checking in pattern-based optimizations.
