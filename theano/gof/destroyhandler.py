    Parameters
    ----------
    fgraph
        The FunctionGraph to check for cycles.
    orderings
        Dictionary specifying extra dependencies besides those encoded in
        Variable.owner / Apply.inputs.

        If orderings[my_apply] == dependencies, then my_apply is an Apply

        of dependencies must be executed before my_apply.

        The DestroyHandler class detects when a graph is impossible to evaluate
        because of aliasing and destructive operations.

        Several data structures are used to do this.

        When an Op uses its view_map property to declare that an output may be
        aliased to an input, then if that output is destroyed, the input is also
        considering to be destroyed. The view_maps of several Ops can feed into
        one another and form a directed graph. The consequence of destroying any
        variable in such a graph is that all variables in the graph must be
        considered to be destroyed, because they could all be refering to the
        same underlying storage. In the current implementation, that graph is a
        tree, and the root of that tree is called the foundation. The `droot`
        property of this class maps from every graph variable to its foundation.
        The `impact` property maps backward from the foundation to all of the
        variables that depend on it. When any variable is destroyed, this class
        marks the foundation of that variable as being destroyed, with the

class DestroyHandler(toolbox.Bookkeeper):  # noqa
    """
    The DestroyHandler class detects when a graph is impossible to evaluate
    because of aliasing and destructive operations.

    Several data structures are used to do this.

    An Op can use its view_map property to declare that an output may be
    aliased to an input. If that output is destroyed, the input is also
    considered to be destroyed. The view_maps of several Ops can feed into
    one another and form a directed graph. The consequence of destroying any
    variable in such a graph is that all variables in the graph must be
    considered to be destroyed, because they could all be refering to the
    same underlying storage.

    In the current implementation, that graph is a tree, and the root of that
    tree is called the foundation.

    TODO: why "in the current implementation" ? is there another implementation
          planned?
    TODO: why is the graph a tree? isn't it possible that one variable could
          be aliased to many variables? for example, don't switch and ifelse
          have to do this?

    The original DestroyHandler (if 0'ed out above) computed several data
    structures from scratch each time it was asked to validate the graph.
    Because this happens potentially thousands of times and each graph to
    validate is extremely similar to the previous one, computing the
    data structures from scratch repeatedly was wasteful and resulted in
    high compile times for large graphs.

    This implementation computes the data structures once at initialization
    and then incrementally updates them.

    It is a work in progress. The following data structures have been
    converted to use the incremental strategy:
        <none>

    The following data structures remain to be converted:
