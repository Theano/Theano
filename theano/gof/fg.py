    A FunctionGraph represents a subgraph bound by a set of input variables and a
    set of output variables, ie a subgraph that specifies a theano function.
    The inputs list should contain all the inputs
    on which the outputs depend. Variables of type Constant are
    not counted as inputs.

    The FunctionGraph supports the replace operation which allows to replace a
    variable in the subgraph by another, e.g. replace (x + x).out by (2
    * x).out. This is the basis for optimization in theano.

    This class is also reponsible for verifying that a graph is valid
    (ie, all the dtypes and broadcast patterns are compatible with the
    way the the Variables are used) and for annotating the Variables with
    a .clients field that specifies which Apply nodes use the variable.
    The .clients field combined with the .owner field and the Apply nodes'
    .inputs field allows the graph to be traversed in both directions.

    It can also be extended with new features using
    FunctionGraph.attach_feature(<toolbox.Feature instance>).
    See toolbox.Feature for event types and documentation.
    Extra features allow the FunctionGraph to verify new properties of
    a graph as it is optimized.
    # TODO: are there other things features can do to the fgraph?
