    WRITEME
    A FunctionGraph represents a subgraph bound by a set of input variables and
    a set of output variables, ie a subgraph that specifies a theano function.
    The inputs list should contain all the inputs on which the outputs depend.
    Variables of type Constant are not counted as inputs.

    The FunctionGraph supports the replace operation which allows to replace a
    variable in the subgraph by another, e.g. replace (x + x).out by (2
    * x).out. This is the basis for optimization in theano.

    This class is also reponsible for verifying that a graph is valid
    (ie, all the dtypes and broadcast patterns are compatible with the
    way the the Variables are used) and for annotating the Variables with
    a .clients field that specifies which Apply nodes use the variable.
    The .clients field combined with the .owner field and the Apply nodes'
    .inputs field allows the graph to be traversed in both directions.

    It can also be extended with new features using
    FunctionGraph.attach_feature(<toolbox.Feature instance>).
    See toolbox.Feature for event types and documentation.
    Extra features allow the FunctionGraph to verify new properties of
    a graph as it is optimized.
    # TODO: are there other things features can do to the fgraph?

    Historically, the FunctionGraph was called an Env. Keep this in mind
    while reading out-of-date documentation, e-mail support threads, etc.

    The constructor creates a FunctionGraph which operates on the subgraph
    bound by the inputs and outputs sets.

    This class keeps a pointer to the inputs and outputs, and also modifies
    them.

    #TODO: document what variables are[not] set in the FunctionGraph when a
    feature is added via the constructor. How constructed is the
    FunctionGraph?

    Parameters
    ----------
    inputs
        Inputs nodes of the graph, usually declared by the user.
    outputs
        Outputs nodes of the graph.
    clone
        If true, we will clone the graph. This is useful to remove the constant
        cache problem.

    Notes
    -----
    The intermediate nodes between 'inputs' and 'outputs' are not explicitely
    passed.
