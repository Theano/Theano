    This function will build the symbolic graph for convolving a mini-batch of a
    stack of 2D inputs with a set of 2D filters. The implementation is modelled
    after Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).


    Parameters
    ----------
    input: symbolic 4D tensor
        Mini-batch of feature map stacks, of shape
        (batch size, input channels, input rows, input columns).
        See the optional parameter ``input_shape``.

    filters: symbolic 4D tensor
        Set of filters used in CNN layer of shape
        (output channels, input channels, filter rows, filter columns).
        See the optional parameter ``filter_shape``.

    input_shape: None, tuple/list of len 4 of int or Constant variable
        The shape of the input parameter.
        Optional, possibly used to choose an optimal implementation.
        You can give ``None`` for any element of the list to specify that this
        element is not known at compile time.

    filter_shape: None, tuple/list of len 4 of int or Constant variable
        The shape of the filters parameter.
        Optional, possibly used to choose an optimal implementation.
        You can give ``None`` for any element of the list to specify that this
        element is not known at compile time.

    border_mode: str, int or tuple of two int
        Either of the following:

        ``'valid'``: apply filter wherever it completely overlaps with the
            input. Generates output of shape: input shape - filter shape + 1
        ``'full'``: apply filter wherever it partly overlaps with the input.
            Generates output of shape: input shape + filter shape - 1
        ``'half'``: pad input with a symmetric border of ``filter rows // 2``
            rows and ``filter columns // 2`` columns, then perform a valid
            convolution. For filters with an odd number of rows and columns, this
            leads to the output shape being equal to the input shape.
        ``int``: pad input with a symmetric border of zeros of the given
            width, then perform a valid convolution.
        ``(int1, int2)``: pad input with a symmetric border of ``int1`` rows
            and ``int2`` columns, then perform a valid convolution.

    subsample: tuple of len 2
        Factor by which to subsample the output.
        Also called strides elsewhere.

    filter_flip: bool
        If ``True``, will flip the filter rows and columns
        before sliding them over the input. This operation is normally referred
        to as a convolution, and this is the default. If ``False``, the filters
        are not flipped and the operation is referred to as a cross-correlation.

    image_shape: None, tuple/list of len 4 of int or Constant variable
        Deprecated alias for input_shape.

    kwargs: Any other keyword arguments are accepted for backwards
            compatibility, but will be ignored.

    Returns
    -------
    Symbolic 4D tensor
        Set of feature maps generated by convolutional layer. Tensor is
        of shape (batch size, output channels, output rows, output columns)

    Notes
    -----
        If CuDNN is available, it will be used on the
        GPU. Otherwise, it is the *CorrMM* convolution that will be used
        "caffe style convolution".

        This is only supported in Theano 0.8 or the development
        version until it is released.
