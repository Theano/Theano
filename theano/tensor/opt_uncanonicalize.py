"""
This file implement specialization optimization that break the canonization form of the graph.

Currently their is problem with the order of optimization and the definition of definition of canonized graph.

Right now their is a canonization optimization phase that try to make all equivalent graph identical. This is not always the case, but it do many of the basic stuff canonical. We need to extend the definition of canonization to make this true more often.

The problem this file indent to fix in the future is that in the "Equilibrium" specialization optimization phase, there is optimization that request that the graph is canonical, some other request that this is not true, and some other that break the canonicalization for some optimization. As we can't control the order of those optimization, their is case that some optimization requesting a canonical graph won't be applied as optimization that break the canonicalization form of the graph executed before.

To fix this, we need to split the specialization phase into a phase where optimization can't break the canonicalization form and one where this is allowed. This is also needed for the stabilized optimization phase, but as it happen before the specialization phase, this cause less problem.

Also, we should make the env refuse optimization that break the canonization of the graph in the optimizations phases where the graph is supposed to be canonical.
